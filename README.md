# Mini Website Project

## 📜 Overview

This is my mini website project for **The Odin Project**, where I applied some essential web development skills to create a simple, yet stylish site. The assignment helped me practice basic HTML and CSS, and gave me a chance to explore some fun design techniques, like gradients, boxes, and hover effects—because, of course, once I learned gradients, I couldn't resist sprinkling them everywhere (just like any new web dev). Want to add a little extra flair to your page? Throw a gradient on it! Boxes need a bit of pizazz? Add some more gradient! It's basically my new best friend.

## 🛠️ What I Learned

In this project, I tackled a few things that are now second nature to me:

- **Responsive design**: I made sure my site looks great on devices of all sizes (because who doesn't love a little mobile-first magic?).
- **CSS styling**: I had fun experimenting with everything from flexbox layouts to creative button hover effects, but the star of the show was definitely the gradients and the box-shadow effects I learned to use *way* too often.
- **Layouts**: Creating sections that break down into neat, readable blocks of content was a must for the site to stay organized.

## 🚀 Features

- A sticky header with a colorful gradient background.
- Hero section with an image, gradient overlay, and some snazzy text.
- Info sections with interactive boxes and hover effects.
- A fun quote section that gives off major "here's a bit of wisdom for you" vibes.
- CTA (Call To Action) section to motivate users to click, because who doesn't love a good button?

## 📝 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArisVahn/mini-website.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the magic unfold.
4. Delete "/mini-website" from all page and image links. I discovered a script solution for it, but it didn't feel right to add it without getting there at The Odin Project.

## 🔮 Next Steps

While I’ve polished up this website with a bunch of CSS tricks, I know it’s still just a static page. In the future, I’m looking to integrate JavaScript for more interactivity. But for now, it's all about that stylish, gradient-filled aesthetic.
