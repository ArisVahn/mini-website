Mini Website Project
Overview
This is my mini website project for The Odin Project, where I applied some essential web development skills to create a simple, yet stylish site. The assignment helped me practice basic HTML and CSS, and gave me a chance to explore some fun design techniques, like gradients, boxes, and hover effects—because, of course, once I learned gradients, I couldn't resist sprinkling them everywhere (just like any new web dev). Want to add a little extra flair to your page? Throw a gradient on it! Boxes need a bit of pizazz? Add some more gradient! It's basically my new best friend.

What I Learned
In this project, I tackled a few things that are now second nature to me:

Responsive design: I made sure my site looks great on devices of all sizes (because who doesn't love a little mobile-first magic?)
CSS styling: I had fun experimenting with everything from flexbox layouts to creative button hover effects, but the star of the show was definitely the gradients and the box-shadow effects I learned to use way too often.
Layouts: Creating sections that break down into neat, readable blocks of content was a must for the site to stay organized.
Features
A sticky header with a colorful gradient background.
Hero section with an image, gradient overlay, and some snazzy text.
Info sections with interactive boxes and hover effects.
A fun quote section that gives off major "here's a bit of wisdom for you" vibes.
CTA (Call To Action) section to motivate users to click, because who doesn't love a good button?

Next Steps
While I’ve polished up this website with a bunch of CSS tricks, I know it’s still just a static page. In the future, I’m looking to integrate JavaScript for more interactivity. But for now, it's all about that stylish, gradient-filled aesthetic.
