                <h1>About GatesAreOpen</h1>
                <p>Welcome to GatesAreOpen, the place where learning to code is almost as easy as clicking "Next" on a YouTube tutorial. We're here to turn your coding nightmares into slightly less terrifying dreams—assuming you haven’t stumbled on the first pages of our website yet.</p>
            </div>

                    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                    <p>We believe coding should be accessible to everyone, even those who’ve been stuck watching motivational "learn to code" videos and are now terrified to open a text editor. Our goal is to make the internet slightly less broken, one confused coder at a time (and yes, our early pages were probably part of the broken internet).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-box">
                    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                    <p>We offer bite-sized lessons, practical projects, and a healthy dose of sarcasm to help you build something functional (even if it’s just a glorified to-do list). Our approach started a bit rough around the edges, but hey, look at us now—getting better with every page!</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Why GatesAreOpen?</h2>
                    <p>Because who wouldn’t want to learn to code from a website named after a gate that refuses to close? We’ve evolved, we’ve polished, and we’ve made it through the worst of it. But don’t worry, the frustration is still part of the fun. Let’s just say, we’ve learned a lot from our "rusty gates" phase.</p>

            <div class="about-summary">
                <p>So, whether you’re here because you’ve been binge-watching coding tutorials or because your friend promised you coding was easier than fixing their computer... welcome! Grab your keyboard, avoid our first pages if you can, and prepare for confusion, frustration, and the occasional moment of sheer coding brilliance.</p>

            <p>Yes, I learnt about these cool boxes whilst coding the website and liked it very much so I made everything a box, destroying my clean layout.</p>
            <p>But it's all about the journey. right?</p>
